## Experience Gained

While doing this project i had a great exposure of writing efficient REST API,s and how to efficiently handle it in client side and managing the state using React and dynamically update the UI.I have performed all the crud operations efficently in this project.Also i have a great experience of using many moongoose commands which i haven,t used earlier.Designing the UI was a challenging part but i enjoyed.After doing the project I think that the upcoming projects i will not be facing that much difficulty as i faced in this project as first time i was implementing so many things in this project.
